# Push_swap_42school
The project push_swap that sorts integers given as arguments with the help of two stacks and limited number of operations (pdf file attached).

# Usage
You need to compile the program and then give the program integers that you want to sort.

So, your steps -

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/VladlenaSkubi-du/Push_swap_42school.git [folder's name you want]

Get into it and compile the checker and push-swap-programs:

    cd [folder's name you want]
    make

After you make:

    ./checker [numbers you want]

...and then input 2 or 3 letters for operations to be done. To finish the input, you send ctrl + D signal (EOF in Unix, ^D on Mac OS)

For example:

    ./checker 5 10 2 8 4 15

and then:
pb
pb
pb
sa
pa
rra
pa
rra
pa
rra
rra
^D

Paralelly you can check the output using the same arguments for original ls-command and ft_ls-program. I hope it will show the same results.

Go and try. Good luck!
